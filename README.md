# Summary

A collection of MuJoCo models for various robots (real and toy examples).

These models are mainly models I have been using for my own PhD work and are **NOT** made by me. I have made small modifications to some of the files occasionally for my own purposes, so use at your own risk!

These models are grouped together for another repository of mine [TrajOptKP](https://github.com/DMackRus/TrajOptKP), to be used in gradient-based trajectory optimisation (please check it out :) )
